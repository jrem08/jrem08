<h4 align="center">ðŸ’»I am a programmer and web developer. Programming lover looking for new projects, ideas and knowledge.</h4>
<br>
After finishing high school, I began my career as a programmer by taking a full stack course at Coderhouse where I acquired part of my knowledge that currently continues to be updated daily.
<br>
Now, while I am studying as a systems analyst at university, I am looking for all kinds of work and projects that continue to train me in what I like.
