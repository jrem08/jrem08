<h4 align="center">ðŸ§ª I am a QA enthusiast and software tester in training. Passionate about ensuring quality at every stage of software development, I am always looking for new projects, ideas, and knowledge to improve testing processes.</h4>
<br>
After finishing high school, I began my career in technology at CIAF, where I gained solid foundations in programming, web development, software quality, and requirements gathering. 
<br>
Over time, I discovered my passion for Quality Assurance (QA), an area that allows me to combine my technical background with analytical thinking to detect, prevent, and solve problems, ensuring better user experiences.
